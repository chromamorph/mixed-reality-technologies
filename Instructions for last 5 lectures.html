<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>There are five remaining sessions scheduled for the MRT
    course. These sessions are in the afternoons on the following dates:</p>
<ul>
    <li>MRT 8: 26 Oct
    </li>
    <li>MRT 9: 28 Oct
    </li>
    <li>MRT 10: 2 Nov
    </li>
    <li>MRT 11: 4 Nov
    </li>
    <li>MRT 12: 10 Nov
    </li>
</ul>
<p>These remaining sessions will take a different format from
    the ones that we have had so far.</p>
<p>For the remainder of this course, you will work in groups of
    two to produce an interactive, real-time performance, built with TouchDesigner,
    that you will present at the final session on 10 November. Each group will
    receive four, 30-minute supervisions with me, where I can monitor your progress
    and help you with achieving the goals that we agree on for your project.</p>

<p>The six groups will be as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Group 1: Dorian Celestyn Sinclear and Ask Lindblad Fogsgaard</li>
    <li>Group 2: Matias Gaarde and Maria Julie Sneding Rohde</li>
    <li>Group 3: Lucas Arngrimson and Victor Elgaard Mikkelsen</li>
    <li>Group 4: Lenette Kappelhøj Langsø and Shobana Sutharsan</li>
    <li>Group 5: Lizette Mary Guldfeldt and Anne-Kathrine Søndergaard Møller</li>
    <li>Group 6: Linda Birch Flensborg and Jesper Thiemer Hansen</li>
</ul>
<p>If I have missed out anyone who should be included, or
    included anyone I shouldn't have, then please let me know asap.</p>
<p>Each of the sessions 8 to 11 (i.e., the ones on 26.10,
    28.10, 2.11 and 4.11) will be divided into six, 30-minute supervisions, one for
    each group, which will take place in my office (5.354), not your group area. </p>
<p>The six supervisions within each of these four sessions will
    be scheduled as follows:</p>
<ul>
    <li>12.30 - 13.00 Group 1</li>
    <li>13.00 - 13.30 Group 2</li>
    <li>13.30 - 14.00 Group 3</li>
    <li>14.00 - 14.30 Group 4</li>
    <li>14.30 - 15.00 Group 5</li>
    <li>15.30 - 15.30 Group 6</li>
</ul>
<p>For your first supervision in the afternoon on 26.10 you
    should bring along a first draft of a proposal that you have worked on with
    your group partner that describes what you will aim to achieve in your
    performance on 4 November. You may use the guidelines that I provided for the
    first miniproject as a starting point, but this is not mandatory. Your proposal
    can take any form that you find most appropriate (e.g., 1-2 page document, a
    short series of slides, a set of diagrams or visual plans, etc.)</p>
<p>In order to pass the course, you need to create a performance to present on 4 November
    that demonstrates that you have attained a sufficiently high
    level of competency in using TouchDesigner as an expressive tool for real-time
    interactive multimedia performance.<br></p>
<p>Do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions
    regarding the above.</p>
<p>Kind regards,<br>Dave</p>
