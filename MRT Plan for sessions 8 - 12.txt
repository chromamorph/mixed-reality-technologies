There are five remaining sessions scheduled for the MRT course. These sessions are in the afternoons on the following dates:

MRT 8: 26 Oct
MRT 9: 28 Oct
MRT 10: 2 Nov
MRT 11: 4 Nov
MRT 12: 10 Nov

These remaining sessions will take a different format from the ones that we have had so far. 

For the remainder of this course, you will work in groups of two to produce an interactive, real-time performance, built with TouchDesigner, that you will present at the final session on 10 November. Each group will receive four, 30-minute supervisions with me, where I can monitor your progress and help you with achieving the goals that we agree on for your project.

The six groups will be as follows:

Group 1
	Dorian Celestyn Sinclear
	Ask Lindblad Fogsgaard

Group 2
	Matias Gaarde
	Maria Julie Sneding Rohde

Group 3
	Lucas Arngrimson
	Victor Elgaard Mikkelsen

Group 4
	Lenette Kappelhøj Langsø
	Shobana Sutharsan

Group 5
	Lizette Mary Guldfeldt
	Anne-Kathrine Søndergaard Møller

Group 6
	Linda Birch Flensborg
	Jesper Thiemer Hansen
	
If I have missed out anyone who should be included, or included anyone I shouldn't have, then please let me know asap.

Each of the sessions 8 to 11 (i.e., the ones on 26.10, 28.10, 2.11 and 4.11) will be divided into six, 30-minute supervisions, one for each group, which will take place in my office (5.354), not your group area. 

The six supervisions within each of these four sessions will be scheduled as follows:

12.30 - 13.00	Group 1
13.00 - 13.30	Group 2
13.30 - 14.00	Group 3
14.00 - 14.30	Group 4
14.30 - 15.00	Group 5
15.30 - 15.30	Group 6

For your first supervision in the afternoon on 26.10 you should bring along a first draft of a proposal that you have worked on with your group partner that describes what you will aim to achieve in your performance on 4 November. You may use the guidelines that I provided for the first miniproject as a starting point, but this is not mandatory. Your proposal can take any form that you find most appropriate (e.g., 1-2 page document, a short series of slides, a set of diagrams or visual plans, etc.)

In order to pass the course, you need to create and present a performance that demonstrates that you have attained a sufficiently high level of competency in using TouchDesigner as an expressive tool for real-time interactive multimedia performance. We therefore need to agree on a set of goals for your project that are sufficiently challenging for this to be the case.

Do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions regarding the above.
